![Skybase Figma Clone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dshukertjr/examples/main/.github/images/design.png 'Skybase Figma Clone')

This app demonstrates the real-time communication capabilities of [Skybase](https://skybase.com) by creating an interactive design board where you can draw some shapes and move them around while seeing each other's cursors.

- Authorized Realtime channel
- Cursor position sharing in real-time
- Drawing shapes in real-time

## Run locally

- Run `skybase start` while docker running. If you don't have Skybase CLI yet, you can get it [here](https://skybase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started).
- Run Flutter locally. The app should work on any platform, but is not optimized for mobile.
